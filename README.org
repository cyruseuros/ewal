* Summary

This is a [[https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal][pywal]]-based theme generator for Emacs with an eye towards [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][Spacemacs]],
and [[https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme][spacemacs-theme]], but no dependencies on either (or any external dependencies
for that matter), so you can use it to colorize your vanilla Emacs as well
(using the lower-level =ewal-get-color= utility function).

=ewal= doesn't only extract special and regular colors from =pywal=, it adds
extra shades to them which it can intelligently suppress in a TTY
context. =ewal= will only return base =pywal= colors in a TTY, which would
ordinarily not be supported, but can be displayed if the following command is
run:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
source ~/.cache/wal/colors-tty.sh
#+END_SRC

If you don't want to do that, it also supports approximating colors returned by
=tty-color-alist=.

=ewal= currently fully supports =spacemacs-theme=, colorizing everything it does,
with fine grained control if you want it, or using an automatic setup function
if you don't. It can even customize Spacemacs cursor colors! Here's the config I
have in my =spacemacs/user-init=:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (load-file "~/projects/ewal/ewal.el")
  (setf spacemacs-evil-cursors (ewal-get-spacemacs-evil-cursors-colors)
        spacemacs-theme-custom-colors (ewal-get-spacemacs-theme-colors)
        spacemacs-theme-org-highlight t
        theming-modifications
        `((spacemacs-dark (page-break-lines :background ,(ewal-get-color 'background -2))
                          (line-number :background ,(ewal-get-color 'background 0)))))
  (load-theme 'spacemacs-dark t t)
#+END_SRC

My hope is that =ewal= will remain theme agnostic, with people contributing
functions like =ewal-get-spacemacs-theme-colors= for other popular themes such
as [[https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs][solarized-emacs]], making it easy to keep the style of your preferred theme,
while adapting it to the rest of your theming setup. But, of course, it's FOSS!
Do whatever you want with it, just make the world a little cooler in the
process ;)

PRs are more than welcome!

** Note to =Spacemacs= and =spacemacs-theme= Users and Maintainers 
If you're using =spacemacs-theme= as jut another package in vanilla =Emacs=, you
should experience no problems.

However, since =spacemacs-theme= is part of the =spacemacs-bootstrap= layer, it
is loaded before everything else. And since =spacemacs/user-init= is called
before =load-path= is fully populated, it's impossible to =require= this
package, while using =with-eval-after-load= sets the requisite environment
variables long after =spacemacs-theme= is loaded.

Get in touch if you have any advice on integrating this into the =Spacemacs=
boot process, and eventually into the repo itself!
* Overview
For more a more detailed description of =ewals= capabilities, please consult the
source docstrings, as they are quite extensive for every function and variable,
and offer the benefit of code navigation to related functionality (which is
dutifully referenced wherever possible). Nevertheless, the following---though
not exhaustive---set of tables should get you started:

#+CAPTION: Variables
| Variable                                 | Description                                                                 |

| =ewal-extended-palette=                  | all colors accessible to =ewal-get-color= in a nice gradient format         |
| =ewal-spacemacs-theme-gui-colors=        | GUI colors for spacemacs theme                                              |

| =ewal-get-color=                        | Choose color from =ewal-extended-palette= by symbol name and shade, choosing whether to only approximate it.                        |
| =ewal-get-spacemacs-theme-colors=       | Get =ewal= colors in =spacemacs-theme-custom-colors= format, mostly preserving theme style, except for a slightly more modern look. |
| =ewal-get-spacemacs-evil-cursor-colors= | Get =ewal= colors in =spacemacs-evil-cursors= format.                                                                               |
