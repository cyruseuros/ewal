A dependency-free, pywal-based, automatic, terminal-aware Emacs
color-picker and theme generator.

* Updates
- =ewal-doom-themes= have been added!
- =ewal-wal-json-file= has been renamed to =ewal-json-file=.
- =ewal-load-wal-colors= has been renamed to =ewal-load-colors=.
- =ewal-get-color= has been renamed to =ewal-load-color=. =ewal--get-color= has
  now been exposed as =ewal-get-color=. Both functions do the same thing, except
  that =ewal-load-color= will always call =ewal-load-colors= first, while
  =ewal-get-color= expects the user to do so first, for a marginal performance
  improvement.
- =ewal-spacemacs-theme-*-high-contrast= have been deprecated. To achieve the
  same effect =(setq ewal-shade-percent-difference 10)=

* TODOs
- Add =ewal-doom-themes= screenshots.

* Overview
A theme isn't just a colorscheme. =ewal= lives by that. It uses =pywal= as a
backend to spruce up your Emacs setup by default, but also sports over 200 built
in palettes to do so if you don't use the program (or *shudders*, you use a DOS
system).

It adds extra shades to =pywal= palettes and makes your Emacs look sexy in a GUI
and in a terminal (=pywal= users only). =ewal-spacemacs-themes= shows what ewal
can do in 400 flavors of =spacemacs-theme= and =doom-themes=, while
=ewal-evil-cursors= spices up, well, your evil cursors. It also provides a
function to colorize =spaceline= accordingly. All these packages (with the
excepton of doom themes) are available on MELPA.

* Usage
These are the fundamentals. For more detail, see the docstrings.

Get a color and a specific shade (+ for ligther, - for darker):
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (ewal-load-color 'magenta +4)
#+END_SRC

Use built-in palettes if your =pywal= theme fails to load (otherwise
you just get a black-and-white theme and something about color being
nil):
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (setq ewal-use-built-in-on-failure-p t)
#+END_SRC

Always use built-in palettes:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (setq ewal-use-built-in-always-p t)
#+END_SRC

Pick a built-in palette:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (setq ewal-built-in-palette "sexy-material")
#+END_SRC

Set custom folder and custom filename for =pywal= scheme (if you use
=wpgtk= or keep your own palette somewhere on your system):
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (setq ewal-json-file "~/path/to/cache-file")
#+END_SRC

Use special cursor for insert state when evil insert bindings are disabled:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (setq ewal-evil-cursors-obey-evil-p t)
#+END_SRC

My config with all its warts:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package ewal
    :init (setq ewal-use-built-in-always-p nil
                ewal-use-built-in-on-failure-p t
                ewal-built-in-palette "sexy-material"))
  (use-package ewal-spacemacs-themes
    :init (progn
            (setq spacemacs-theme-underline-parens t
                  my:rice:font (font-spec
                                :family "Source Code Pro"
                                :weight 'semi-bold
                                :size 11.0))
            (show-paren-mode +1)
            (global-hl-line-mode)
            (set-frame-font my:rice:font nil t)
            (add-to-list  'default-frame-alist
                          `(font . ,(font-xlfd-name my:rice:font))))
    :config (progn
              (load-theme 'ewal-spacemacs-modern t)
              (enable-theme 'ewal-spacemacs-modern)))
  (use-package ewal-evil-cursors
    :after (ewal-spacemacs-themes)
    :config (ewal-evil-cursors-get-colors
             :apply t :spaceline t))
  (use-package spaceline
    :after (ewal-evil-cursors winum)
    :init (setq powerline-default-separator nil)
    :config (spaceline-spacemacs-theme))
#+END_SRC
