* Summary

This is a [[https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal][=pywal=]]based theme generator for Emacs with an eye towards Spacemacs
[[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][=Spacemacs=]], and [[https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme][=Spacemacs-theme=]], but no dependencies on either (or any
external dependencies for that matter), so you can use it to colorize your
vanilla Emacs as well (using the lower-level =`ewal-get-color'= utility
function).

=ewal= doesn't only extract special and regular colors from =pywal=, it adds
extra shades to them which it can intelligently suppress in a TTY
context. =ewal= will only return base =pywal= colors in a TTY, which would
ordinarily not be supported, but can be displayed if the following command is
run:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
source ~/.cache/wal/colors-tty.sh
#+END_SRC

If don't want to do that, it also supports approximating colors returned by
=`tty-color-alist'=.

It currently fully supports =Spacemacs-theme=, colorizing everything it does,
with very fine grained control if you want it, or using an automatic setup
function if you don't. It can even customize spacemac cursor colors! Here's the
config I have in my =`spacemacs/user-init'=:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(load-file "~/projects/ewal/ewal.el")
(setq spacemacs-evil-cursors (ewal-get-spacemacs-evil-cursors-colors))
(setq spacemacs-theme-custom-colors (ewal-get-spacemacs-theme-colors))
(setq spacemacs-theme-org-highlight t)
(setq theming-modifications
      `((spacemacs-dark
          (page-break-lines :background ,(ewal-get-color 'background -2))
          (line-number :background ,(ewal-get-color 'background 0)))))
(load-theme 'spacemacs-dark t t)
#+END_SRC

My hope is that =`ewal'= will remain theme agnostic, with people contributing
functions like =`ewal-get-spacemacs-theme-colors'= for other popular themes such
as [[https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs][Solarized-emacs]], making it easy to keep the style of your preferred theme,
while adapting it to the rest of your theming setup. No problem should ever have
to be solved twice, so PRs are more than welcome!
